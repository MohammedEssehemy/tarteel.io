<h1>About Tarteel</h1>

<h2> What is Tarteel? </h2>

Tarteel is an open-source project designed to help build digital tools to analyze the recitation of the Quran. Given the important place of reciting the Quran in the lives of Muslims, it is important to build software tools that can help ordinary Muslims recite the Quran with greater accuracy and appreciation. The name <i>tarteel</i> comes from the Quran itself, where God commands us to "recite the Quran with <i>tarteel</i> (slow, measured rhythmic tones)." 

<h2> What is the Tarteel 10,000 Challenge? </h2>

The goal of the Tarteel 10,000 Challenge is to build the world's first public dataset of Quranic recitations carried out by <i>ordinary Muslims</i>. Most of the available audio of the Quran being recited is from professional reciters with strong fluency in <i>tajweed</i> (rules of recitation) and is recorded in studios. This is valuable when someone wants to listen to a recitation of the Quran.  

However, many software tools that Muslim developers are interested in building require training <i>machine learning</i> models on Quranic recitation, as it is recited by ordinary Muslims. This recitation differs from professional recordings in many ways: for example, it may include background noise, or may be recited by people with limited knowledge of <i>tajweed</i>, or the demographic backgrounds of reciters may be limited.
